# React + Vite (wrong Kasa app)

The text below seems accurate don't pay too much attention this app is Kasa app made with react via Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Launch  front 
npm start

# Don't use this as this command, it is used to create the app + few steps missing tho
npm create vite@latest front-end -- --template react

# Missing step? install vite first
npm install -g vite
